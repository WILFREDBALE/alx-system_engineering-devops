    What is the role of the application server?

    What are the issues with this infrastructure?

a. SPOF (Single Point of Failure): Since the infrastructure is composed of a single server, any hardware or software failure could cause the entire website to become unavailable.

b. Downtime when maintenance is needed: Any changes to the application code or server configuration would require a restart of the web server, resulting in downtime.

c. Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic: With a single server, it becomes difficult to handle a large number of requests as the server's resources become constrained.    User's Computer
