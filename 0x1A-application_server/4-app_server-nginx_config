# To gain a thorough understanding of Nginx configuration files and fully harness the power of Nginx, it is recommended to refer to the following URLs:

# In most cases, administrators typically remove this file from the "sites-enabled/" directory but keep it as a reference inside the "sites-available/" directory, where it continues to receive updates from the nginx packaging team.

# This file automatically loads configuration files provided by other applications such as Drupal or Wordpress. These applications are accessible via a path corresponding to the package name, e.g., "/drupal8".
